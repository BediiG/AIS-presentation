# Secure Auth Demo â€“ Final Version

This project is a complete demonstration of secure authentication and session management best practices using **Flask** (backend) and **Vue 3** (frontend). Originally developed as a hands-on lab for the **Advanced Information Security** course at UKIM, this finished version implements OWASP-compliant techniques and production-ready session flows.

## Features

- User registration with password strength validation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- Stateless session handling using JWT:
  - Access and refresh token issuance
  - Token refresh and expiration
  - Secure logout via cookie invalidation
- Secure cookies for storing JWTs (HTTP-only)
- HTTPS support with self-signed certificates
- CORS setup with credential handling

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask, Flask-JWT-Extended, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Bcrypt
- **Frontend:** Vue 3, Vite, Axios
- **Security:** JWT, Secure Cookies, HTTPS, Password Hashing
- **Config:** Environment variable loading with `python-dotenv`
